      <h1>Our Concept</h1>
      <p>
        Since June 2018, we have worked tirelessly to provide people with the best possible natural wine at fair, honest, and democratic prices. While Pompette is possibly one of the most reasonably priced wine bars/shops in town, it is equally important to us that we have the best product possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        With our combined experience in natural wine spanning decades, it is of the utmost importance to maintain the highest standard possible of professional acumen combined with our laid back atmosphere and relaxed approach to wine.
        <br />
        <br />
        We aim to work with people we know and vouch for winemakers who understand the importance of regenerative agriculture. Whether or not it is certified organic or biodynamic, the Pompette team prioritises winemakers who are working with the right philosophy: to give more back to the earth what
        we get from it and minimise unwanted and unnecessary intervention in both farming and wine-making.

      <p>“Pompette” is a french slang, used to describe when you are sligthy drunk, or as we say in Danish “lettere beruset”.</p>

      <h1>Meet our Winemakers</h1>
      <p>
        We are proud to represent some of the most lovely and colourful people we have ever met. To truly represent someone we know and that we may call a friend is such an honour, and we hope that you can taste it in the wine. We are always looking for an end-product in harmony - not only with
        their philosophy but also with their personality: The people behind it. Below, you can meet just a couple of the winemakers we take pride in working with. If we were to talk about them all, this page would definitely be too long.
